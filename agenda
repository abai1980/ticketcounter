Creating a Telegram Captcha bot:
- basic idea [x]
- demonstration [x]

Follow up:
- amend the callback data for buttons [x]
- if one fails to solve the captcha remove the buttons [x]
- give a time period for which one is allowed to solve the captcha [x]

well that should do, shall we check?

same as far I am aware, but this could be a workaround for what the user was asking for isnt it.. with that
being said, thats all for today... :-)
